## Version control software

@ul
- Revision Control System (RCS)
- Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
- Microsoft Word Track Changes
- Subversion
- git
- mercurial
- darcs
@ulend

## All about git

- Distributed version control system
- Developed by Linus Torvalds and others to manage the Linux kernel
- Linus named it after himself
- Designed to be fast
- Very widely used in academia and industry

## The Linux kernel development under git

[Visualised with gource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkJxlKD2bjk)

---

## git under the hood

- Different from earlier systems such as RCS, CVS and Subversion: no diffs
- Originally developed under Linux, but available elsewhere
- No central repository, but can synchronise with remotes
- Cloud-hosted repository servers: github; gitlab; bitbucket

Recommend you use github with education: free private repositories

## Key concepts in git

@ul
- A __file__ (in a path)
- A __commit__: a snapshot of a collection of files at a particular time
- A __branch__: a linear sequence of commits
- A __repository__: (possibly) many branches of a project
- A __remote__: another place where a repository is stored
@ulend

## Key commands in git

Working on the command line
```
git init
git add
git status
git commit
git push
```

---

## git init

Creates a directory `.git` where everything is stored

You may also want to do `git config` at this stage

Think about adding a `.gitignore` file

---

## git add

Puts the current working version of a file into the staging area

Preparing for a commit

Check what will be committed with `git status`

---

## git commit

Makes a commit based on currently staged files

Will start an editor (see git config)

Consider
```
git commit -m "message"
```
to avoid editor

---

## git push

Pushes a branch to a remote repository

`git push origin master`

`origin` defined by
```
git remote add origin
```
or
```
git clone
```
