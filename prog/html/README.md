## Today

* HTML tags
* What makes a good HTML page
* Interview
* Web front-end frameworks


## HTML tags

(In groups) 
* Introduce yourselves
* List the HTML tags you are familiar with 
  - five minutes
* One person to create a text file with them in
  - one per line


## Putting them together

* Paste into second column of shared doc
* We'll make a [word cloud](https://www.wordclouds.com/)


## What makes a good HTML page?

* Standards compliant HTML5 [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/) @fa[af-html5]
  - Check with <https://validator.w3.org/>
  - Or chrome plugin
* Accessible: alt tags; contrast; [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/); [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)
* Mobile-friendly: viewport; lightweight; responsive
* Quick-loading
* Review with e.g. [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)


## Interview with Soumya Singh


## Web Front-end Frameworks

- Provide pre-written HTML and JavaScript
- Apply styles with CSS classes
- Make it easy to make things look nice
- Make it easy to make things responsive
- Can sometimes be heavy (large file size, slow)
- e.g. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)


## WeLoveSue

And to prove it we can

- make our page HTML5 compliant
- include it in a bootstrap template
