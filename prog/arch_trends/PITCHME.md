## Context of Modern Computing

::: incremental

- [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) keeps on giving
- [Dennard scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling) doesn't since about 2006
- Power dissipation (switching) goes up with cube of clock speed
- Static power dissipation starts to dominate at small scale
- Trend towards multi-core
- Extreme end is GPU/TPU

## Power is Important

::: incremental

- Cooling for integrity (run at 9GHz with liquid nitrogen)
- Battery (mobile)
- Cloud computing power costs (including cooling)

## Virtualisation vs Parallelisation

- Opposite directions
- Number of linear clock cycles not so important
- Some tasks can effectively be parallelised, some can't
- Send the program to the data: google search
- Remember [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law)

## Cloud Computing

- http v1.1 (1997) multiple names for one IP address
- virtualisation vs timesharing
- docker images: multiple machines on same physical machine
